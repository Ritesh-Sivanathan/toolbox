# Mathematical Toolbox

This project is a toolbox of all the mathematical functions one could need. I will continue developing it to match my ever evolving mathematical skills (currently sitting at basic Linear Algebra and nearly wrapping us single-variable Calculus).

Once this project is more mature, I plan to use it primarily to develop my more complex projects.

## Currently Supported Functions

- Matrix Determinant
- Matrix Transpose
- Matrix Adjoint
- Cofactor Matrix
- Inverse Matrix
- Matrix Multiplication - Scalar by any Matrix

- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide - Constants or simple Binomials

## Testing

There are a good amount of tests in `toolbox/testing/testcases` that test the vital matrix operations

This project is still a work in progress. For any questions or concerns, please contact me at: ritesh.sivanathan@gmail.com
