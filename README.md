# Mathematical Toolbox

This project is a toolbox of all the mathematical functions one could need.
Just a way to apply the mathematics I'm learning

## Currently Supported Functions

- Matrix Determinant
- Matrix Transpose
- Matrix Adjoint
- Cofactor Matrix
- Inverse Matrix
- Matrix Multiplication - Scalar by any Matrix
- Gaussian Elimination (works for square matrices only -- code needs refactoring, but works)
- Vector Operations (Addition, Scalar Multiplication, Cross/Dot Product)

- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide - Constants or simple Binomials

## Testing

There are a good amount of tests in `toolbox/testing/testcases` that test the vital matrix operations

This project is still a work in progress. For any questions or concerns, please contact me at: ritesh.sivanathan@gmail.com
